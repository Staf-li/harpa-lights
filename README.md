# The Harpa Lights project

A collection of games, audio visualisers and other adventures for the lights of Harpa ([http://harpa.is](http://harpa.is))

This repository builds on the work done for Harpa PONG+ (see the old repo here: [https://github.com/owenhindley/harpapong](https://github.com/owenhindley/harpapong)).

Project development led by ([Owen Hindley](http://www.owenhindley.co.uk))

Project concept & production by Atli Bollason

## What's in the repo?

This repo contains the following:

* A Render server; takes input from the other modules & sends out DMX
* A 'Screensaver' server for music-driven visualisers
* A number of sound-reactive visualisers contributed by the team
* A PONG game server
* A Breakout game server (work in progress)
* A Queue manager
* A front-end site with a mobile paddle controller & instructional splash page

Currently everything is built for **node v4+**, running on **OSX**. 

Windows users should be able to get up and running, but will have to go their own way when installing some of the more exotic node-modules and their dependencies, namely [node-canvas / Cairo](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/_pages).

## Why is it here?
Harpa is a public building in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, and it's the hope of the founders of this project that by publishing what we've done already open-source, it will enable and encourage more artists to get involved with the project and / or submit their own concepts for the lights of this landmark building. More information about calls for projects [here](http://en.harpa.is/harpa/news/harpa-calls-light-based-projects).

## Getting Started / Installation
Getting up & running with the repo depends on what you want to do. See below:

### Creating a music-reactive visualiser
* Download the repository
* Open up `/dev/visualiser-creator`
* Run `npm install`
* To run the visualiser tester ( you could even call it a visualiser *visualiser* ) do the following :
	* If you have Grunt installed, use the included `Gruntfile.js` which will run an http-server on `127.0.0.1:8080`. Instructions for installing grunt [here](http://gruntjs.com/using-the-cli)
	* If you'd rather not, you can simply run an HTTP-server from within this folder and view `index.html`
* Replace the included MP3 with one of your own if you wish.
* By default, the audio will play, and the tempo counter will start.
* Clone `visualisers/HarpaTestVisualiser.js`, look at how it works, and create your own.

### Running the render-server
You'll only need to do this if you're actually doing an installation in Harpa and need to output DMX.

(coming soon)

### Creating a game for Harpa
The repository comes with two games - PONG and Breakout (all trademarks belong to their respective owners). 

We've run PONG successfully on two occasions, Breakout has yet to be shown publicly.

If you want to create your own game, download the repository, examine `game-server` and `queue-server`, specifically how they transmit the canvas data back to the `render-server`, as this is what you'll need to emulate.

(more detailed instructions coming when I have time)
